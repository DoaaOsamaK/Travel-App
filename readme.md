# Custom Travel App

## Project Summary

This project is designed to help you apply and showcase your skills by building a custom travel app. The application is JavaScript-heavy, focusing on DOM manipulation, object handling, and interacting with multiple APIs. It leverages Webpack for module bundling, an Express server for backend operations, and service workers for offline functionality.

## Features

- **Dynamic Travel App**: Plan trips and get real-time data.
- **API Integration**: Uses three APIs (Weatherbit, Geonames, and Pixabay) to fetch travel-related data.
- **JavaScript Focus**: Emphasizes DOM manipulation and object handling.
- **Webpack Setup**: Bundles assets and JavaScript modules.
- **Express Server**: Manages API requests and serves data.
- **Service Workers**: Provides offline access for improved user experience.
